    <h1>Hello, this is a website with two pages</h1>
    <p>This website is a two page website if you did not notice from the title,
     and I am a person with experience with Python and some HTML experience.I learnt Python from
     a channel named bro code, credits to him.By now I don't even actually know how
     many websites I have tried to make by the way.So for now this is the first page 
     of the website.That's all for this page, click the link to go to the other page.
    </p>

    <a href="page-2.html" target=_self title="This will take you to the next page">
        Go to page-2
